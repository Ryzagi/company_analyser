# Company Analysis Telegram Bot

A system for analyzing companies using Gemini AI and providing results through a Telegram bot interface. You can find the bot at [@Company_Analyzer_Bot](https://t.me/CompanyAnalysisBot).

## Overview

This project combines the power of Google's Gemini AI model with a Telegram bot interface to provide detailed analysis of companies. Users can send company names or descriptions to the Telegram bot, which will return structured information including:

- Company details (name, website, industry, location)
- Company description
- Key people
- Competitors analysis with strengths and comparisons

## Architecture

The project consists of two main components:

1. **Analyzer API** - FastAPI service using Google's Gemini model for company analysis
2. **Telegram Bot** - User interface for interacting with the analyzer

Microsoft competes directly in cloud computing and productivity software, while Apple challenges in the mobile OS and consumer hardware space through tight hardware-software integration [17].
